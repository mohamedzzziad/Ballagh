(Ballagh) is an anonymous crime reporting platform designed to create a safer society by giving people a secure and confidential way to report crimes and misconduct.

It works by offering a simple and accessible online channel where anyone can submit a report, with options for guided assistance or direct input, ensuring that reports are clear and useful.

The purpose is to build trust, encourage transparency, and protect individuals who might otherwise remain silent out of fear of retaliation.

The platform is for citizens, victims, and witnesses who want to speak up safely, and for law enforcement agencies and NGOs who rely on credible, anonymous reports to act effectively.
